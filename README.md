# **Microservices Communication Blogs**

This repository contains a series of **comprehensive blog posts** I wrote on **inter-service communication in Spring Boot microservices**. Each blog demonstrates a different approach for building production-ready, scalable, and maintainable service-to-service integrations.

---

## **Blogs Overview**

### 1. **RESTTemplate for Inter-Service Communication**

* Full CRUD operations using Spring Boot `RestTemplate`
* Handling headers, query parameters, path variables
* Exception handling and best practices
* Synchronous service-to-service calls

### 2. **RestClient (Spring 6 / Boot 3)**

* Modern replacement for `RestTemplate`
* Full CRUD with headers, query parameters, and path variables
* Global exception handling
* Supports both blocking and reactive calls
* Type-safe, declarative, and cleaner syntax

### 3. **Feign Client (Spring Cloud)**

* Declarative REST client with interface-based HTTP calls
* Full CRUD with headers, query parameters, and path variables
* Integration with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer and service discovery
* Global exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice` and custom Feign error decoder

### 4. **WebClient (Reactive)**

* Reactive, non-blocking HTTP client
* Full CRUD operations with reactive streams
* Headers, query parameters, and request bodies
* Exception handling with reactive operators
* Ideal for high-performance and streaming microservices

## **Key Features Covered Across Blogs**

* Synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
* Passing multiple headers, query parameters, and path variables
* Error handling and global exception strategies
* Best practices for production-ready microservices
* Type-safe and reactive programming approaches

## **Purpose**

These blogs aim to provide **hands-on guidance** for developers learning microservice communication patterns in Spring Boot, comparing **classic, modern, and reactive approaches**, and implementing **robust error handling** for real-world applications.

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone this repository or follow the blog posts individually.
2. Each blog contains **full code examples, step-by-step instructions, and testing guidance**.
3. Use the examples as a reference for building **inter-service communication in your microservices architecture**.
